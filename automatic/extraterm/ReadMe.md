## Features

### Shell Integration
Use the shell integration to unlock Extraterm’s power.

Command output is clearly marked and return status of commands is clearly visible. Interesting command output can be put in its own tab, or just delete it directly. Bash, zshell and fish are currently supported. Extraterm features a powerful keyboard based cursor mode. Copy and paste without having to leave the keyboard.

### Reusing Command Output
The “from” command lets you use previous command output as input for terminal commands. This enables new fast “ad hoc” workflows.

Or you can edit the command output directly in place and execute the selection with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
