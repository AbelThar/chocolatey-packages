*NeatMouse* is a small tool for Windows that allows controlling your mouse cursor via keyboard.

This is very useful when your physical mouse is unavailable:

- If you haven’t installed its driver yet, and Windows was unable to do this automatically.
- If you use wireless mouse and its battery is low so you need to charge it.
- If you are a person with reduced mobility.
*NeatMouse* also comes in handy when you need high precision in mouse pointer moving. It allows setting pointer moves accuracy up to one pixel.
