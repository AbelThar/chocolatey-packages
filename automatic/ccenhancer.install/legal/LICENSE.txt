Software Licenses (Pro Club)
Pro Club exclusive software titles can be installed on as many computers as you personally administrate. You will only have access to online documentation and priority support during your membership to SingularLabs. These resources will not be available after your membership has expired. You may continue using our products once your Pro Club subscription has expired.

Pro Club members operating a PC repair or maintenance business may install branded copies of System Ninja Pro onto their client’s computers, however they assume all responsibility for the support of these users.

By joining SingularLabs Pro Club you agree not to redistribute our commercial software titles. You further agree not provide third-parties with access to your SingularLabs Pro Club account. Violation of these terms will result in the termination of your account, without a refund.

Pricing
The price of SingularLabs Pro Club may fluctuate over time. If you chose to renew your membership, we will continue to honor the pricing that was offered when you initially opened your account. If the price of SingularLabs Pro Club is decreased during your membership, you will not be entitled to a partial refund. You will, however, be able to take advantage of the new pricing should you choose to renew your membership.

Refunds
Once you have downloaded and installed our Pro software titles, you are not entitled to a refund unless it can be confirmed that the product does not function as advertised.

This policy is enforced to limit purchase-download-dispute fraud. A dispute with a payment processor will result in the immediate termination of your account under the assumption that your purchase was made fraudulently.

Changes to Terms of and Conditions
SingularLabs may, at its sole discretion, revise or change these Terms and Conditions (in whole or in part) from time to time and at any time without notice to you.
