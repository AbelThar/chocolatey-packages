    <description><![CDATA[## About
Dust3D is a cross-platform open-source modeling software. It helps you create a 3D watertight model in seconds. Use it to speed up your character modeling in game making, 3D printing, and so on.

## Free and Open-Source
Yes, it's free. And it's cross-Platform, no matter you are on Windows, Linux, or MacOS, the same experience you'll get. Give it a try.

## The Easiest Game Asset Pipeline
With Dust3D, you'll see yourself finish a game asset in a blink! Dust3D also supports export your model as FBX and glTF format, so that you can then import the files into softwares like Unity and Godot for further development. Read the article here to know the whole process.

## Start Modeling with Zero Experience
Believe it or not, you don't need any experiences to make a 3D model with Dust3D, all you'll need are good reference photos. There're more videos on this.
