QRQ is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer which runs on several operating systems (Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows), similar to the classic DOS version of [Rufz](http://www.rufzxp.net) by DL4MM.

It's not intended for learning telegraphy (check out [LCWO](http://lcwo.net) or have a look at [radio.linux.org.au](http://radio.linux.org.au/?sectpat=morse&ordpat=title) for CW learning software), but to improve the ability to copy callsigns at high speeds, as needed for example for [Contesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting).
