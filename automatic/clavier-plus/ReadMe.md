Clavier allows creating keyboard shortcuts involving almost any key, including the Windows keys located around the spacebar.

The created shortcuts can be associated to launching programs or writing text.

You always launch the same programs, navigate to the same websites? Create a simple shortcut to do it quicker.

Tired of writing your E-mail address? Create a universal keyboard shortcut to write it: it will work under Word, Excel, and your favorite Internet browser!

## Translations

If you would like to contribute an additional translation, please contact me at guillaume@ryder.fr for detailed instructions. Do not use resource translation software that modify executables or produce \*.rc files as I would not be able to your the result of your work. Instead, I will prepare a special copy of [Clavier.rc](https://github.com/guilryder/clavier-plus/blob/master/Clavier.rc) for you to work with.
