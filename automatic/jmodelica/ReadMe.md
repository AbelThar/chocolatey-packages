The main objective of the project is to create an industrially viable open source platform for simulation and optimization of Modelica models, while offering a flexible platform serving as a virtual lab for algorithm development and research. As such, JModelica.org provides a platform for technology transfer where industrially relevant problems can inspire new research and where state of the art algorithms can be propagated from academia into industrial use. JModelica.org is a result of research at the [Department of Automatic Control](http://www.control.lth.se), Lund University, and is now maintained and developed by [Modelon AB](http://www.modelon.se) in collaboration with academia. 

JModelica.org is distributed under the GPL v.3 license approved by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org).

JModelica.org at a glance:

- *_Model_* your systems using the object-oriented and equation-based language Modelica
- *_Solve_* your complex simulation and optimization problems using state of the art numerical algorithms
- *_Automate_* your work in the Python scripting environment
- *_Visualize_* your results

JModelica.org is compliant with the Modelica Standard Library.
