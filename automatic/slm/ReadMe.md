Softros LAN Messenger is an easy-to-use LAN essaging application for safe, secure and effective intra-office communication. It does not require a server to run and is very easy to install. Softros LAN IM comes with a variety of handy features such as PC-to-PC messaging, group LAN chat rooms, broadcast messaging to quickly notify selected individuals or groups about an event, and also drag-and-drop file transfer to exchange files and folders between staff members. All messages and files exchanged by the users are securely encrypted and never go outside your local company network, which guarantees that no unauthorized person will ever read your private correspondence or access your sensitive data.

## Features
## Security, Safety and Privacy
The Softros LAN chat software encrypts all data with AES-256 and works strictly within your company network. This allows your employees to safely exchange messages and files, while discouraging them from chatting with people outside the organization. It also saves your Internet bandwidth and minimizes the number of opened firewall ports that could result in outside hacker attacks and IM worms.
## Ease of Installation and Use
The instant messenger from Softros has a very intuitive interface and requires no additional training. All you need to do is install and run it on each network computer. Users themselves can easily configure the program without requesting assistance from the IT staff.
## Serverless Architecture
You do not need to set up and maintain a dedicated messaging server – our IM tool is a stand-alone peer-to-peer based application.
## Individual and Group Conversations
Exchange messages with just one or multiple users at the same time.
## Group Messaging
Notify individual users or whole user groups about an event by sending out a broadcast message.
## Offline Messaging
Send messages to users even when they are offline. Offline messages are received when the users come back online. No server or dedicated storage is required for this.
## File Transfer
Easily exchange documents with your colleagues. Just drag and drop a file or folder on the recipient's icon in the user list or on the conversation you are having with them.
## Broadcast File Transfer
You can easily send files and folders to multiple users at the same time right within a group conversation or a broadcast message.
## User Groups
Arrange your co-workers in groups by department or job title. You also can add users to multiple groups at the same time.
## Remote Desktop Sharing
Request remote assistance using LAN Messenger, and the colleague on the other end will securely connect to your desktop to help you configure Windows, install an application, or resolve a technical issue.
## Message History
Keep track of your messages by saving them locally or to a network share. View, search through and print out your correspondence with other employees using the built-in History Viewer.
## Terminal Services Support
Full support of Microsoft and Citrix Terminal Services environments (including the RemoteApp and XenApp application virtualization technologies).
## Active Directory and Domain Support
Softros Intranet Messenger seamlessly works in a correctly set up domain controller environment with Active Directory. Users' full names retrieved from Active Directory are displayed in the user list, while their SIDs are used for identification purposes within the program.
## LAN, WAN, VPN and VLAN Support
Enhanced functionality of the Softros local chat application allows you to link your company locations or subnets into a single messaging environment. Just connect your subnets physically, virtually or with a VPN and then configure the program by referring to our detailed help system.
## Network Wide Group Policy Deployment
In a domain controller environment, deploying the Softros messaging software, its license and settings across the network can be easily done through Group Policy.
## Importing, Exporting and Pre-configuring User Settings
In case your company does not have a domain controller with Active Directory, Softros LAN Messenger allows you to automate distribution of its settings (network settings, user groups, license file, administrative restrictions) using certain built-in features.
## Restricting User Access
Administrators can selectively restrict access to most features of the Softros communication software.
