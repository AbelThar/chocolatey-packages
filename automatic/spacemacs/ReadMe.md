***The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!***

Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Just clone it, launch it, then press the space bar to explore the interactive list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press the home buffer's `[?]` button for some great first key bindings to try.

Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix the two editing styles. Switching easily between input styles makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.

Spacemacs is currently in beta, and contributions are very welcome.

## Features

- **Great documentation:** access documentation in Emacs with `SPC h SPC`.
- **Beautiful GUI:** you'll love the distraction free UI and its functional mode-line.
- **Excellent ergonomics:** all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the `space bar` or `alt-m`.
- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like `SPC b` for all the buffer commands or `SPC p` for the project commands.
- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely organised in configuration layers following a set of [conventions](http://spacemacs.org/doc/CONVENTIONS).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing `SPC h SPC`.

You can also check the [general documentation](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION), [quick start guide](http://spacemacs.org/doc/QUICK_START) and the [FAQ](http://spacemacs.org/doc/FAQ).

## Prerequisites

### Emacs

Spacemacs requires Emacs 24.4 or above. The development version of Emacs (at the time of writing, this is 25.2) is not *officially* supported, but should nevertheless be expected to work.

Some modes require third-party tools that you'll have to install via your favorite package manager.
