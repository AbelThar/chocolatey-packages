## Features
Extraterm is a open source terminal emulator which aims to add many new features to bring the traditional terminal into the modern era.

It is currently in steady development and although not at a 1.0 release yet, it is generally stable for everyday use provided you can tolerate the occasional bug. (Submit bug reports here .)

### Command Palette
Extraterm is designed for keyboard use first. The Command Palette makes it easy to find and execute any command without leaving the keyboard.

### Reusing Command Output
The “from” command lets you use previous command output as input for terminal commands. This enables new fast “ad hoc” workflows.

Or you can edit the command output directly in place and execute the selection with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
