    <description><![CDATA[
Gpredict is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction application. It can track a large number of satellites and display their position and other data in lists, tables, maps, and polar plots (radar view). Gpredict can also predict the time of future passes for a satellite, and provide you with detailed information about each pass.

Gpredict is different from other satellite tracking programs in that it allows you to group the satellites into visualisation modules. Each of these modules can be configured independently from the others giving you unlimited flexibility concerning the look and feel of the modules. Naturally, Gpredict will also allow you to track satellites relatively to different observer locations - at the same time.

Gpredict is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) licensed under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). This gives you the freedom to use and modify gpredict to suit your needs. Gpredict is available as source package as well as precompiled binaries available via third parties.

## Features

- Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical
  memory and processing power of the computer
- Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination
  of these
- Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
  windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
- You can use many ground stations
- Predict upcoming passes
- Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
  backward), and manual time control
- Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes
- Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld
- Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld
