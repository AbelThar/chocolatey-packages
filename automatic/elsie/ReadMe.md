Elsie™ is an uncommon commercial-grade lumped-element ("L-C") electrical filter design and networkanalysis program, directed toward the engineer, technician or hobbyist involved in that line of work.

- The free Student Edition of Elsie is quite adequate for student use or for use by small manufacturing operations.But with the key it operates in the more capable Professional Edition.


- The principal difference between the Student Edition and the Professional Edition of Elsie lies in the StudentEditions's limit on the number of network components. In addition, the editing library of manually-entered componentsis restricted somewhat in the Student Edition to inductors, capacitors, resistors, and series and shunt jX entries. Nolines, stubs, transformers or coupled inductors are allowed. The Professional Edition allows those components andothers to be manually entered.


- That "number of network components" is 7 for the Student Edition and 41 for the Professional Edition. For filterdesign, the order is 7 for the Student Edition and 21 for the Professional Edition excepting Bessel and Gaussian whichare limited to 10 (because the normalized values are from a lookup table).


- Elsie is 32-bit Windows® electrical filter design software nicely written to help engineers design and analyzelumped-element filters in the audio through microwave range. Thanks to the standard interface, all of the variousaspects of program operation are quite easy to use. Most options are selected by clicking on buttons. No scripts. Not aDOS lookalike. Schematics are drawn correctly, not using text characters.


- This filter design program designs and then analyzes filters with a wide variety of topologies and families andwith specified orders, bandwidths, impedances and the like. The usual filter families of Butterworth, Chebyshev, Cauer(including the zig-zag transform), Bessel, Gaussian, Constant-K and M-derived are covered.
