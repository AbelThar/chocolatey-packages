[Milton](https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton) is an open source application that lets you Just Paint.

There are no pixels, you can paint with (almost) infinite detail. It feels raster-based but it works with vectors. It is not an image editor. It is not a vector graphics editor. It is a program that lets you draw, sketch and paint. There is no save button, your work is persistent with unlimited undo.

## What Milton is not

Milton is not an image editor or a vector graphics editor. It's a program that
lets you draw, sketch and paint.

## User Manual

If the GUI makes something not-obvious, please create a [github issue](https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton/issues)!

It's very helpful to drag the mouse (or pen) while pressing `space` to pan the
canvas.  Also, switching between the brush and the eraser with `b` and `e`.
You can change the brush size with `[` and `]` and control the transparency
with the number keys.
