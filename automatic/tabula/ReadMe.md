## How Can Tabula Help Me?
If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful it is — there's no easy way to copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data into a CSV or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface. Tabula works on Mac, Windows and Linux.

## Who Uses Tabula?
Tabula is used to power investigative reporting at news organizations of all sizes, including [ProPublica](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars), [The Times of London](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4048545.ece), [Foreign Policy](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/06/13/crs_report_details_us_expenses_on_iraq), [La Nación (Argentina)](http://interactivos.lanacion.com.ar/mapa-elecciones-2013), [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/us/gun-sales-terrorism-obama-restrictions.html?_r=1) and the [St. Paul (MN) Pioneer Press](http://www.twincities.com/nation/ci_25247140/where-insurance-premiums-are-highest-new-health-laws).

Grassroots organizations like [SchoolCuts.org](http://www.schoolcuts.org) rely on Tabula to turn clunky documents into human-friendly public resources.

And researchers of all kinds use Tabula to turn PDF reports into Excel spreadsheets, CSVs, and JSON files for use in analysis and database applications.
