A COM component for transceiver/receiver CAT control.
## Features
- **Multi-threading**: multiple programs, written by different authors in different languages, can control the radio via Omni-Rig at the same time; 
- **External rig description files**: the support of a new rig model can be implemented just by creating an ini file that describes the CAT commands of the radio.

Please consider participating in the project by testing the code and the rig description files, or by creating your own rig description files.
