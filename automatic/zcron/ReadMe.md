Automate your tasks with Z-Cron â€“ The Task and Backup Scheduler
With Z-Cron you can plan the execution of commands, programs or scripts, at particular times, so that recurring tasks on your PC are run automatically on schedule. Z-Cron is a central coordinating point for the scheduling or automation of software. Z-Cron can also be installed a system service. A system service is a program that starts automatically when Windows was booted, and runs in the background until Windows is shut down. With the Z-Cron scheduler you can have programs of all kinds started automatically by the system even if no user is logged in â€“ for example nightly data backups with Z-DBackup.

Example tasks that can be scheduled with Z-Cron:
- Starting and stopping of applications (also with parameters).
- Calling or saving of Websites.
- Loading documents.
- Starting, stopping and monitoring system services (professional version).
- Copying, moving and deleting files and directories.
- Cleanup of directories.
- Archiving and compressing files and directories.
- Switching computers in a network on or off.
- Automated switching of electrical devices, e.g. with Z-USBswitch.
- Establishing and disconnecting internet/VPN connections (Modem/ISDN).
- Putting computers to standby mode and waking them up automatically.

These tasks can be started automatically at the following points in time:
- Daily (every x days).
- Weekly (every x weeks at a weekday you can choose).
- Monthly (at the x calendar day or the x weekday of a month).
- Once.
- After the system startup.
- In regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes, every hour, etc.)

You can use Z-Cron scheduler in many different ways, for example:
- Regular data backup (for example with Z-DataDVD or Z-DATdump).
- Automatic switching of electrical equipment or devices (for example with Z-USBswitch/Z-ParSwitch).
- Automatic FTP data transfer (for example with Z-FTPcopyII).
- Defragmentation and Scandisk
- Virus scans
