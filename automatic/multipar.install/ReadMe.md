MultiPar can do file verification, error detection, correction and recovery to protect your files and folders from deletion, copy errors, download errors, software errors, hardware errors, virus infection, malicious tampering, and all other forms of data corruption.

MultiPar was made as an alternative to QuickPar.  While it looks like a multi-lingual version of QuickPar, there are some good features; Unicode characters, directory-tree, faster repairing, smaller recovery files, batch scripting, and so on.

## Features
MultiPar supports both PAR 1.0 and PAR 2.0 specifications.

See the [Parchive project](http://parchive.sourceforge.net) for details of Parchive.
