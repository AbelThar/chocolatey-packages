## Efficient & easy-to-use interface.

SpeedCrunch displays results as you type. Select a partial expression to evaluate only that part.

Previous inputs and results are shown in a scrollable history and can be easily recalled. Customizable syntax highlighting allows you to spot mistakes easily.

If you prefer the old-school way, an optional on-screen keypad is available as well.


## Powerful.

SpeedCrunch comes with over 80 built-in mathematical functions. You can also define your own functions.

Variables allow you to store your results. Perform calculations with up to 50 digits of precision, using complex numbers, numeral bases, unit conversions, and more.

Auto-completion allows you to speed up your task.


## Library included.

Or insert one out of over 150 built-in scientific constants.


## Cross-platform. And multi-language.
SpeedCrunch is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and comes in [a number of languages](https://www.transifex.com/heldercorreia/speedcrunch/languages).
