This application provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for generating images from LaTeX equations. These images can be dragged and dropped or copied and pasted into external applications (presentations, text documents, graphics...), or can be saved to disk in a variety of formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, EPS, PDF, etc.). In addition to the graphical user interface, a command-line interface and a C++ library is provided to perform the same job.

## Short History
KLatexFormula was written by Philippe Faist, currently (2017) a post-doc at Caltech, Pasadena, USA. First released in 2006 written in KDE3 environment, the program has seen many improvements and restructuring since then, leading to the current version, written in Qt 5.

_KLatexFormula is a non-KDE application_
The *K* in the name KLatexFormula is there for historical reasons. Since version 3.0, KLatexFormula is not a KDE-specific application; it is based on Qt (Qt 5 since version 4.0) and runs natively on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
