__WIN__+__CTRL__+__ALT__+__NumberKeys__  
__WIN__+__CTRL__+__ALT__+__LEFT__ or __RIGHT__

__Pin/Unpin Windows:__

__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.

## System Tray Icon  
- Choose from several sets of icons  
- The icons indicate which desktop you are viewing  
- `Left-Click` the system tray icon to display or hide DesktopView.  
- `Right-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the main menu.
