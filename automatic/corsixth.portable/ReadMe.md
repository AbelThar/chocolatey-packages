CorsixTH aims to re-implement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to load the original game data files. This means that you will need a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been re-implemented in open source code, the project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to the original game can be made.

## Notes
To play CorsixTH, you will need either the [Demo](http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip), or the full game of Theme Hospital, available for example at [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/theme_hospital).
