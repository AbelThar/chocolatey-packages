    <tags>photoflow photo retouching RAW image editor</tags>
    <summary>A fully non-destructive photo retouching program providing a complete RAW image editing workflow.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
The aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive photo retouching program with a complete workflow including RAW image development.

Here is the general feature (wish)list:

- Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image
- Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis
- Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying rendering engine based on the VIPS library
- Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...
- Support for layer grouping and layer masks
- Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers
You can follow the development of photoflow and learn about its usage in the dedicated blog: http://photoflowblog.blogspot.fr/
