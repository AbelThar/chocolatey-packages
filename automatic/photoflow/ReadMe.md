The aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive photo retouching program with a complete workflow including RAW image development.

Here is the general feature (wish)list:

- Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image
- Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis
- Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying rendering engine based on the VIPS library
- Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...
- Support for layer grouping and layer masks
- Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers
