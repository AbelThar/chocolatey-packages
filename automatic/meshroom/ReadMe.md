Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.

Learn more details about the pipeline on [AliceVision website]'http://alicevision.github.io).

See [results of the pipeline on sketchfab](http://sketchfab.com/AliceVision).

## Requirement
NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU (compute capability >= 2.0).

## Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs. It infers the geometry of a scene from a set of unordered photographs or videos. Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, losing depth information. The goal of photogrammetry is to reverse this process.

See the [presentation of the pipeline steps](http://alicevision.github.io/#photogrammetry).
