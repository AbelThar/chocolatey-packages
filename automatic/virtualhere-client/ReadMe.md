Traditionally USB devices needed to be plugged directly into your computer to be used. With VirtualHere this is no longer required, the network itself becomes the cable transmitting USB signals (also known as USB over IP, USB/IP, USB over WiFi, USB over Ethernet, USB Device Server).

This USB server solution is perfect for allowing USB devices to be used remotely over a LAN network, over the Internet, or in the [Cloud](https://www.virtualhere.com/cloud) without the USB device needing to be physically attached to remote client machine. The USB device appears as if it was directly attached even though it is plugged in to a remote server, therefore all existing drivers and software work, no special changes required.

The VirtualHere USB Client runs on Windows, OSX, Linux and Android. The client was created to be intuitive and extremely easy to use. The client needs to be run on any machine that wants to use USB devices shared by the VirtualHere USB Server.

For advanced users, the client can run as a run as a [service](https://www.virtualhere.com/client_service), and is controllable using an [API](https://www.virtualhere.com/client_api) and supports [SSL](https://www.virtualhere.com/ssl_setup).

The software will automatically find USB devices shared by VirtualHere USB Servers on the network. Available USB devices will be displayed in a tree. Right click on the device you want to use and select Use. It will then appear to be directly connected to your machine and can be used just like a local device!
