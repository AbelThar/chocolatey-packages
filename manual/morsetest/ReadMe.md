These programs allow you to create Morse either from keyboard entries, or by using a TXT file such as created with Windows Notepad. You can also use the Mouse as a Morse Key, one even as a simple LBUG for repetitive Dots and Dashes. The speed and tone can also be changed and a variety of suitable instrumental sounds used with one version, including using the little single speaker in the Console. This new version 4 now includes the option to use the Farnsworth system of learning, or to include a small selected random delay to attempt to Humanise the timing.
