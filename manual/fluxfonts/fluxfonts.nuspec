    <summary>A continual font generator for increased privacy.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
Fluxfonts is a specialized tool that attempts to tackle the privacy concerns raised by the possibility to collect information about the fonts installed on a system. Such information can be used to uniquely identify a system. With Fluxfonts, new fonts are randomly created and removed to prevent the same fingerprint from being recreated.

New fonts are generated by the daemon every 2 to 40 minutes. Fonts are generated at random times in this time window. However, they are generated more often when not running on battery power.

Font fingerprinting is a technique which is difficult and usually inconvenient for users to circumvent by other means. Fluxfonts is fully automated and runs in the background. By effectively always having a new unique fingerprint, it should prevent a system from being (re-)identified between applications and websites/-browsers.
