Precision CW Fistcheck helps you to train your Morse/CW keying abilities.
Just connect your straight or semiautomatic key to a Morse buzzer and connect the buzzer's output to the audio input of your PC or laptop.
Or - with just a small one-resistor-interface and a serial RS232/COM interface - connect your key directly to the PC.
The program will show you what you are keying, mark and space, dots and dashes. It will even try to decode the Morse characters you have formed.
