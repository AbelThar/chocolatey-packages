Your gateway to all things Blizzard

## Your games in one place
### Play your games
Your Blizzard games are easily accessible so you can quickly jump in and start playing. When you’re not playing, the app automatically updates each game to the latest version.

### Discover new adventures
Curious about a game you don’t have installed? Give it a try right from its game tab. Most Blizzard games are free to try!

### Stay up to date with the latest news
The Battle.net app also has curated news about Blizzard games, events, merchandise, and more – so you never miss out on what’s new at Blizzard.

## Connect with friends and fellow gamers
### Customize your profile
Your profile is a snapshot of your activity and interests, even outside Blizzard games. Choose an avatar to put a public face on your BattleTag.

### Find new friends and see what they’re playing
It’s easy to find and add new friends using the app. When you’re friends, you can see at a glance what they’re up to - so you’ll know when to jump into a game, or when to get one going yourself.

### Chat with friends
Your Blizzard friends are just a click away whether you’re in a game or just have the app open. You can also chat on the go with the Battle.net mobile app.

### Jump into voice chat
Built-in voice chat makes it easy to keep a group coordinated when you’re playing together, and easy to keep together if you move to another game.

### Participate in Blizzard Groups
Blizzard Groups give you a home on Battle.net to connect with friends and other players. They make it easy to discuss strategies, set up play time, or just hang out and chat.

## Shop for digital games and goodies
### The best place to get digital Blizzard games
Purchase new games and expansions directly from the app. You’re only a few clicks away from your next adventure.

### Buy in-game items quickly and easily
The Battle.net Shop is also where you’ll find in-game items such as loot boxes, pets, mounts, and more.

### Exchange digital gifts with friends
Send and receive digital games and in-game items right from the Battle.net app.
