    <description><![CDATA[
## Overview
MorseRabbit is a small utility designed to help you learn to tap and understand Morse Code.

MorseRabbit has two training modes, each with 5 levels of difficulty:

- Normal Mode: You are provided with a morse code sequence (both the visual and audible representation) and are expected to type in the correct word in time.
- Reverse Mode: You are provided with an alphabetic sequence or a word, and are expected to tap the corresponding morse code.

After you master the 5 training levels, you can continue your morse education with these lessons:

- Lesson 6 - Words
This lesson uses dictionary words instead of random letters.
- Lessons 7 and above
In these lessons you practice aspects of morse code that are beyond just knowing the alphabet. You can practice Prosigns (like the well known SOS), abbreviations and Q-Codes.

## Usage
If you want to __Tap a morse sequence to see what word it generates:__

- Stop the training if it is running.
- Start tapping the Spacebar.
- You may adjust the speed slider, to tell MorseRabbit how to listen to your taps.

If you want to __Practice in understanding morse code:__

- Make sure the Reverse Training checkbox is clear.
- Select a difficulty level.
- Press the Start button.
- Now, type the letters representing the morse code you hear.

If you want to __Practice morse code tapping:__

- Make sure the Reverse Training checkbox is checked.
- Select a difficulty level.
- Press the Start button.
- Now, use the spacebar to tap the morse code for the letter. Short press for a DIT, long press for a DAH.
- Pressing backspace, left arrow or delete, will mark the word as failed.
