Little Fighter 2 (LF2) is a popular freeware PC fighting game for Windows and is the sequel to the game to [Little Fighter 1 (LF1)](http://lf2.net/lf1.html). LF2 was created by [Marti Wong](http://martiwong.com) and [Starsky Wong](http://starsky.lf2.net) in 1999, and released in a long series of updates.

The game supports up to 4 human players on one computer and a total of 8 characters using online play or computer-controlled opponents. Characters are controlled using the keyboard or a gamepad. All keys can be set via a configuration menu.

## Gameplay
In LF2, characters can be moved by pressing the respective up, down, left, and right keys. The defend, jump, and attack buttons are used to make the character perform an action. Attacking another character causes him or her to lose HP (health points), represented by a red bar on the heads-up display. Each character also has special attacks that can be activated by pressing a certain combination of keys. Most of these special attacks take up MP (mana points), represented by a blue bar on the heads-up display. 
Items may occasionally fall into the screen to assist players. Occasionally, a bottle of beer or milk may drop down from above, which can be drunk to restore health and/or mana (milk restores mainly HP, and a little amount of MP, whereas beer only restores MP). Once a bottle of beer or milk is finished, your character drops it and the empty bottle breaks and disappears. There are also a variety of weapons that can be used in combat. These include knives, baseballs, baseball bats, hoes, crates, boomerangs, and boulders. All weapons take damage in combat and will eventually break.

## Game Modes
1. VS Mode allows human and computer players to fight each other in a setting of the player's choice.

2. Stage Mode, like in many classic beat-'em-up action games, this allows the players fight their way through five stages, with bosses here and there. You can choose your stage and difficulty at startup.

3. Championship Mode sets up a tournament bracket to determine a winner. You can choose to fight individually, or with a human or computer partner.

4. Battle Mode is a team-based mode involving two sides commanding mass customizable armies of computer players.

5. Demo Mode creates random teams of computer-controlled players, creating a zero-player game.

Difficulty can be set to Easy, Normal, and Difficult for all modes except demo. Additionally, CRAZY! mode can be unlocked when the player types in a secret code on the select player screen. The code can be used in VS and Stage Mode.  
There is also a small online game feature which enables you to connect and experience any of the modes listed above with another person via IP address (public IP), using port 12345. This only allows connection to one other computer.
