# [VBackup - Command Line Backup with File Versioning](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vbackup)

## Disclaimer
**VBackup** should run on most Windows operating systems, although it has only tried on Windows 7, XP and Vista.

## Overview
**VBackup** is a command line program for Windows that is used to make backup copies of directories.
It is similar in functionality to [XCOPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOPY) and [ROBOCOPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy), however, **VBackup** implements file versioning. This means that you can not only restore files from the *latest* backup, but you can also restore them from *any previous* backup.

I wrote **VBackup** for my *personal* use. It has several limitations, but it does everything that I need. I am releasing it as *freeware* (free for both private and commercial use) in case others will also find it useful.

[The source code is available at GitHub](https://github.com/cprineas/VBackup) as a Visual Studio C++ project.

Please visit the *VBackup section* of the [FileViewer Support Forum](http://www.fileviewer.com/forum) for further information.

## Usage
**VBackup** must be run from a Command Prompt. Run `VBackup -?` for an explanation of all the command line option.
